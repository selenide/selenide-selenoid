Selenide Selenoid plugin
================================

A [Selenide](https://selenide.org) extension for working with Selenoid

NB! Project "selenide-selenoid" was merged into project "selenide".
Note that "groupId" will change from "org.selenide" to "com.codeborne".
Now you will need to use dependency "com.codeborne:selenide-selenoid:6.15.0" or higher.
