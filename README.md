Selenide Selenoid plugin
================================

A [Selenide](https://selenide.org) extension for working with Selenoid

## Why it's needed?

Most of Selenide features work with Selenoid out of the box.  
There are only a few things that might not work: proxy and downloading files. 
1. Selenide proxy generally works with Selenoid, except one case: when tests and Selenoid are run on different machines, 
and "test machine" is not accessible from "selenoid machine". 
2. Downloading files: Selenide has 3 methods for downloading files: `HTTPGET`, `PROXY` and `FOLDER`.   
   * `HTTPGET` and `PROXY` work in Selenoid as usually
   * `FOLDER` doesn't work in Selenoid because the downloads folder is inside the container.   

This problem is addressed by `selenide-selenoid` plugin: _it can get files from Selenoid container_. 

## Features
Currently the plugin supports the following features:
* File download 
* Access to clipboard  (get & set & verify clipboard contents)
* BasicAuth

We are going to implement more features like reading logs and videos etc.

## Usage
1. Import `org.selenide:selenide-selenoid:2.3.1`
2. Set `Configuration.fileDownload = FOLDER;`
3. Use method `$.download()` as usually.

## How it works?
When you call `$("a#report").download()` method, Selenide-selenoid plugin
1. clicks the element,
2. lets the browser download file to its default location, 
3. uses [Selenoid API](https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/#_accessing_files_downloaded_with_browser) to get the downloaded file.
